## Casts and coercions

Type indexing `SEXP`'s makes it possible to precisely characterize the
set of values that a function can accept as argument or return as
a result, but this only works well when the forms of R values are
known *a priori*, which is not always the case. In particular, the
type of the result of a call to the `r` quasiquoter is always
`SomeSEXP`, meaning that the form of the result is not statically
known. If the result needs to be passed to a function with a precise
signature, say `SEXP s R.Real -> SEXP s R.Logical`, one option is to
discover the form of the result, by first performing pattern matching
on the result before passing it to the function:

~~~ haskell
f :: SEXP s R.Real -> SEXP s R.Logical

g = do SomeSEXP x <- [r| 1 + 1 |]
       case x of
         (hexp -> R.Int v) -> return (f x)
         _ -> error "Not an int."
~~~

But pattern matching in this manner can be verbose, and sometimes the
user knows more than the type checker does. In the example above, we
know that `[r| 1 + 1 |]` will always return a real. We can use *casts*
or *coercions* to inform the type checker of this:

~~~ haskell
f :: SEXP s R.Real -> SEXP s R.Logical

g = do x <- [r| 1 + 1 |]
       return $ f (R.SInt `R.cast` x)
~~~

A *cast* introduces a dynamic form check at runtime to verify that the
form of the result was indeed of the specified type. This dynamic type
check has a (very small) runtime cost. Note the type of `cast`:

~~~ haskell
cast :: SSEXPTYPE a -> SomeSEXP s -> SEXP s a
~~~

`SSEXPTYPE a` is a so-called singleton [type family][ghc-manual-tf].
To each `SEXPTYPE` corresponds a `SSEXPTYPE a` and vice versa: `Int ::
SEXPTYPE` has `SInt :: SSEXPTYPE Int`, `Char :: SEXPTYPE` has
`SChar :: SSEXPTYPE Char`, etc. The only point of using
[singleton][hackage-singletons] types here is to make the type of the
result of `cast` be determined by the type of its arguments.

If the user is extra sure about the form, she may use *coercions* to
avoid even the dynamic check, when the situation warrants it (say in
tight loops). This is done with

~~~ haskell
unsafeCoerce :: SEXP s a -> SEXP s b
~~~

This function is highly unsafe - it is `inline-r`'s equivalent to
Haskell's `System.IO.Unsafe.unsafeCoerce`. It is a trapdoor that can
break type safety: if the form of the argument happens to not match
the expected form at runtime then a segfault may result, or worse,
silent memory corruption.
